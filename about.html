        <p>I am Meenal Choraria, a passionate and creative student currently pursuing my 4th semester in Fashion Communication at NIFT. With a keen eye for design, storytelling, and visual aesthetics, I love exploring different mediums to express ideas that blend innovation with functionality. My interests lie in digital illustration, branding, and content creation, where I aim to craft compelling narratives through design. Inspired by nature and vibrant color palettes, I enjoy incorporating elements like flowers and butterflies into my work. As I continue my journey at NIFT, I am eager to refine my skills and push creative boundaries to make a meaningful impact in the world of fashion and communication.</p>
